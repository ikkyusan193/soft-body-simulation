# This will contain all the contrainst (I can think of)

# Constraints that must be implemented (if I can)

# Deformable Constraints
# Over-stretching Compensation
# Over-compressing Compensation
#   - Spring Direction Correction:
#   - Spring Length Correction
# Hooke's Law constraints: The only limitation on this law is if the spring is streched beyond its elastic limit

class Constraints:

    particle1 = None
